***Tuttle*** is an eXist-db application that adds version control to data collections in eXist-db.

It is part of and published by the [e-editiones society](https://e-editiones.org/) and can be used by
other eXist-db applications such as TEI-Publisher to synchronize
data collections between the database and a Git repository. 

***Tuttle*** wraps the APIs of the Git service providers under a single, common OpenAPI allowing
projects to seemlessly add version control to their data.
